# Under s6-overlay this no longer works: the bootstrap (UID remap, data-volume

# root-owned and non-writable; mutable runtime state must live under

#
# The supported way to match host-side ownership is to start as root (the image
# default) and pass CLARA_UID/CLARA_GID — or the PUID/PGID aliases — which the

# the exact same outcome (files owned by your host UID) without breaking s6.
#

# the container was started as, so `id -u` here is the host UID (e.g. 1000), and

[stage2] ERROR: container started with --user $cur_uid (an arbitrary, non-clara UID).

This is not supported under the s6-overlay image. The container bootstrap
(UID remap, data-volume ownership, config seeding) needs to start as root,
and the baked /opt/clara install tree is intentionally root-owned and
non-writable, so a pinned --user UID cannot repair startup state — startup
will fail.

To make container-written files match your HOST user, DON'T use --user.
Start the container as root (the default) and pass your host UID/GID instead:

    docker run -e CLARA_UID=\$(id -u) -e CLARA_GID=\$(id -g) ...

NAS users (Synology / unRAID / UGOS) can use the PUID/PGID aliases:

    docker run -e PUID=\$(id -u) -e PGID=\$(id -g) ...

The image remaps the clara user to that UID/GID at boot and chowns the data
volume accordingly, so files land owned by your host user — the same outcome
--user was being used for, without breaking the supervision tree.

# --- Docker socket group membership (docker-in-docker / DooD) ---
# When the user bind-mounts the host Docker daemon socket
# (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) to use the `docker`
# terminal backend from inside the container, the socket is owned by the
# host's `docker` group (or root). The supervised clara user (UID 10000)
# is not a member of any group that matches the socket's GID, so every
# `docker` invocation EACCES'es and `check_terminal_requirements()` fails.
# See #16703.
#
# Granting the supp group via `docker run --group-add <gid>` alone is
# NOT sufficient with our s6-setuidgid privilege drop: s6-setuidgid (and
# gosu, the older shim) calls initgroups() for the target user, which
# rebuilds the supplementary group list from /etc/group. Without an
# /etc/group entry whose GID matches the socket, the kernel-granted
# supp group is silently wiped between PID 1 and the dropped process.
# Confirmed empirically: `--group-add 998` alone leaves the dropped
# clara process with `Groups: 10000` (998 gone); after this hook adds
# the entry, the dropped process has `Groups: 998 10000` as expected.
#
# Fix: detect the socket's GID at boot and ensure /etc/group has a
# matching entry that includes clara. Idempotent across container
# restarts. Skipped silently when no socket is bind-mounted.
#
# Handles the awkward corner cases:
#   - socket owned by GID 0 (root) — some Podman setups; usermod -aG root
#   - socket GID already used by a known container group (e.g. tty=5):
#     reuse that group's name rather than creating a duplicate
#   - clara is already a member of the right group (idempotent restart)
#   - chown/groupadd failures under rootless containers — non-fatal

# providers.clara entry when the on-disk entry is provably terminal OR the
# orchestrator seed has a later obtained_at timestamp. The latter covers the
# stop/update/start sequence where NAS already revoked the still-healthy-looking
# local session. Older/incomparable seeds remain no-ops, so leaving the env set
# cannot roll a healthy rotated token backward. Runs as its own stdlib-only

# gateway_state.json: declare the gateway's INITIAL supervised state on a

#
# On a blank volume there is no gateway_state.json, so the boot reconciler
# (cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles → container_boot.reconcile_profile_gateways)
# registers the gateway-default s6 slot but leaves it DOWN — it only
# auto-starts when the last recorded state was "running". That means a
# freshly-provisioned container comes up with the gateway down until
# someone starts it (e.g. from the dashboard). An orchestrator that
# provisions a fresh volume and wants the gateway running from first boot
# can set CLARA_GATEWAY_BOOTSTRAP_STATE=running; we seed the state file
# here, BEFORE 02-reconcile-profiles runs (cont-init.d scripts run in
# lexicographic order), so the reconciler sees prior_state=running and
# brings the supervised slot up on the very first boot.
#
# This is a generic container contract, not specific to any host: it seeds
# the SAME gateway_state.json the reconciler already consults, exactly as
# CLARA_AUTH_JSON_BOOTSTRAP seeds auth.json. The [ ! -f ] guard is the
# load-bearing part — on every subsequent boot the persisted state wins,
# so a gateway the operator deliberately stopped stays stopped across
# restarts and we never clobber real runtime state.
#

# --- Discover agent-browser's Chromium binary ---
# The image's Dockerfile runs `npx playwright install chromium`, which
# populates ``$PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`` (=/opt/clara/.playwright) with
# a ``chromium_headless_shell-<build>/chrome-headless-shell-linux64/``
# directory. agent-browser (the runtime CLI Clara spawns for the
# browser tool) doesn't recognise this layout in its own cache scan and
# fails with "Auto-launch failed: Chrome not found" — even though the
# binary is right there (#15697).
#
# Fix: locate the binary at boot and export ``AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH``
# via /run/s6/container_environment so the `with-contenv` shebang on
# main-wrapper.sh propagates it into the supervised ``clara`` process
# and thence to agent-browser subprocesses.
#
# - Skipped when the user has already set ``AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH``
#   (lets users override with a system Chrome install).
# - Filename-matched (not path-matched): the chromium dir contains many
#   shared libraries (libGLESv2.so, libEGL.so, ...) which inherit the
#   executable bit from Playwright's tarball but are NOT browser binaries.
#   We only accept files whose basename is chrome / chromium /
#   chrome-headless-shell / headless_shell / chromium-browser. Compare
#   PR #18635's earlier ``find | grep -Ei 'chrome|chromium'`` which would
#   match the path ``.../chrome-headless-shell-linux64/libGLESv2.so`` and
